# Quantum Enhanced Machine Learning Model for Dose Optimization in Early Drug Development

This repository contains our submission for the **Quantum Innovation Challenge 2025** by **Team PNU**.  
We propose a **quantum-enhanced machine learning framework** for optimizing drug dosing strategies in the early stages of pharmaceutical development.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Training a Model
```bash
python main.py --mode {mode} --encoder {encoder} 
```
### Optional Arguments
--use_fe â†’ enable feature engineering
--use_mc_dropout â†’ apply Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation
--use_pt_contrast â†’ activate contrastive learning between PK/PD tasks

### Key Features
#### Training Modes
- independent â†’ PK and PD models trained separately
- cascade â†’ PK and PD models trained jointly with shared information
- multitask â†’ PK first, then PD conditioned on PK outputs

#### Model Architectures
- mlp â†’ Multi-Layer Perceptron
- resmlp â†’ Residual MLP
- moe â†’ Mixture of Experts
- resmlp_moe â†’ Residual MLP + MoE
- qnn â†’ Quantum Neural Network-enhanced MLP
- resqnn_moe â†’ Quantum-enhanced Residual MLP + MoE

#### Advanced Features
- Feature Engineering â†’ time windows, per-kg dosing, future dose information
- PK/PD Contrastive Learning â†’ domain-specific positive/negative pair generation
- Uncertainty Estimation â†’ Monte Carlo Dropout
