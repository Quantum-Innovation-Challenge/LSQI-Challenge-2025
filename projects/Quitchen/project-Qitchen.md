Quantum machine learning offers promising field for humanity in the healthcare sector, demonstrating its significant potential. Therefore, this study aimed to perform prediction using variational quantum neural networks, a type of quantum machine learning. To this end, different coding techniques were tested to determine the best prediction. In this process, calculations were performed using amplitude and angle encoding in the Pennylane library. Based on the results, amplitude encoding, by reducing the dataset, yielded better , MAE, MSE scores than both angle encoding and feature-reduced angle encoding. In addition, it has been shown that very close results are obtained in the scores when the feature-reduced angle embedding.
