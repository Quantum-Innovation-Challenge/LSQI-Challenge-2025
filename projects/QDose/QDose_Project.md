### Project proposal is included as a pdf titled "QDose_Submission.pdf"

Our project aims to explore the advantages of using techniques form quantum computing and AI development at three separate stages of the PK/PD modeling and dosage prediction pipeline. We will look into learning a hamiltonian model, using quantum statistical methods for fitting, and then making future patient predictions via quantum neural-network techniques. All of these stages fit together in a cohesive workflow that we believe will enhance the efficacy of this process.
